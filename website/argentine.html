                    The Argentine Ant is known as the <i>Linepithema humile</i>.  With the name Argentine ant, the ant was orginated within Argentina.
                    It has spread to countless countries.  This species of ant spreads very rapidly.  
                    <br><br>
                    These ants are known as invasive to the biodiversity in any region they
                    inhabit.  They are harmful due to their aggressive nature towards other ant species.  They will attack and kill other ant species that help
                    promote biodiversity in a region. These types of ants are known to disrupt plant life in areas.  They will kill and attack other species of ants and
                    insects that allow plant species to spread their seeds with.  Not only do they harm the insects they steal the seeds the plants need to reporduce and move
                    between areas.
