                    The Asian Needle Ant is known as the <i>Brachyponera chinensis</i>.  It is an invasive species in the 
                    Hampton Roads area.  The asian needle ant origniated in Japan and was able to migrate to the United States.
                    The first locations in the United States were the southeast portion of the country.  Climate and expansion has led them to 
                    move further north into Virginia and the Hampton Roads region.

                    These ants are known as invasive to the biodiversity in any region they
                    inhabit.  They are harmful due to their aggressive nature towards other ant species.  They will attack and kill other ant species that help
                    promote biodiversity in a region.  These ants mainly invade forested areas and have largely negative effects on the many other species that live in 
                    this area.
