                        This project uses the programming language known as R for data modeling and prediction of data. This let us be able ot predict the locations that invasive 
                        species would inhabit in the coming years based on their movement and living areas in the previous years. 
                        <br><br>The program known as ArcGIS was used to overlay data onto a real world map for visualization.  This allowed us to be able to show the locational data 
                        that the data set offers and correlate that with a real world map for easier visualization.
                        <br><br>Excel was used to chart and graph extra data for more visualization.  This allowed for another map similiar to the one that was created in ArcGIS.  Excel
                        was also used for modeling the data set that we had to start with to make it easier to understand for the public.
                        <br><br>The general information used to describe the different ant species in this project was referenced from the <a href="https://www.antwiki.org/" target="_blank">AntWiki</a>.
                        <br><br>The data set for this project was collected by Devin Calpo during a project that he conducted for a college class.  This data was made public <a href="https://github.com/kyle-98/datathon/tree/main/data_public" target="_blank">here</a> on September 8, 2022.
